Low-level programming & Algorithm - Hatching out
=================================================

A low-level programming language is a programming language that provides little or no abstraction from a computer's instruction set architectureâ€”commands or functions in the language map that are structurally similar to processor's instructions. Generally, this refers to either machine code or assembly language. Because of the low (hence the word) abstraction between the language and machine language, low-level languages are sometimes described as being "close to the hardware". Programs written in low-level languages tend to be relatively non-portable, due to being optimized for a certain type of system architecture.wikipedia.

In this REPO, we learn about the following programming methods and basic application
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

212 0x00 Hello, World
213 0x01. C - Variables, if, else, while
214 0x02. C - Functions, nested loops
215 0x04. C - More functions, more nested loops 
539 0x03. C - Debugging
216 0x05. C - Pointers, arrays and strings
217 0x06. C - More pointers, arrays and strings
218 0x07. C - Even more pointers, arrays and strings
219 0x08. C - Recursion
221 0x0A. C - argc, argv
220 0x09. C - Static libraries
222 0x0B. C - malloc, free
223 0x0C. C - More malloc, free
225 0x0E. C - Structures, typedef
224 0x0D. C - Preprocessor
